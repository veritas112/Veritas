This forensic fest aimed at discovering students’             knowledge and understanding of the subject as it offered a wide range of              science related events. The events were conducted by the teachers of the             unit of forensic science.  The fest was executed with a total of 10 events              and was organized at its best of quality. The fest was conducted online due              to the pandemic situation using the ZOOM platform. The high-spirited fo-             rensic fest started with preliminary rounds of various events on 3rd March              2021.                    Atrium, being the first forensic fest in the college the theme was              maintained at crime and investigation. With respect to this, the events             were also organized accordingly. There were a total of ten events planned              for the students to participate in. Cognitionis - the quiz event had a pre-             liminary round and time limit was given for each question to be answered.              This kept the students on their feet even though the competition was             virtual. Events like Scleus Fabula tested their writing and intuitive skills as              the event dealt with writing a crime story but based scientifically. Bring-              ing out the forensic scientist or the detective within them, events like In-             quisitor, Obscura, Fortitudo aimed at testing their investigation, intuitive,              observation skills respectively. Events like Parle (debate), Pictura (Logo             Designing), and Prescripta (sketching) were organized and these events              tested their artistic skills. Realis (the documentary contest) was themed as             “Water - the essence of life”. The last event was Qualis which was based              on the best participation and performance of the students.                    The inaugural ceremony of the fest was presided over by Fr. Lijo. P.              Thomas, Financial Administrator, Head, Dept. of Computer Science, Kristu             Jayanti College and the guest of honour was Mrs. Anu Sebastian, Scientif-              ic Officer, Forensic Psychology Division, Karnataka State Forensic Science              Laboratory. In his presidential address, father enlightened the participants","about the importance of forensic science and its scope in everyday life.              Mrs.  Anu  Sebastian  spoke  on  forensic  psychology  particularly  and  ex-              plained the scope of forensic psychology. She enlightened the students on             the field of forensic psychology and briefed on the tools and techniques              used in this particular domain. During the valedictory ceremony, Dr Cal-             istus Jude felicitated the winners of various events and appreciated the              teachers for having conducted the forensic fest successfully.                     Atrium 2021 attracted a lot of enthusiastic participation. From 130              students certain events like Scelus Fabula, Pictura, etc. had fifty partici-             pants each. Every student got a chance to participate in at least one event.              Since the fest was conducted online and the students had not come to the             college for almost a year due to the pandemic situation this fest helped              the students get in touch with their friends of the same class and also both              juniors and seniors got to know each other. During the fest various stu-             dents got to know their talents and skills and they were able to generate              new ideas and thoughts which helped them and their teams perform well             in the fest. The fest was a great platform to develop leadership and coor-              dination skills among students.

He has experience work-            ing with law and has encountered several cases and            offenders in his years of expertise. We decided to             ask him some questions regarding his various encounters and crime. We            were curious about the representation of lawyers by the media, evidence             seen in court, the role of forensic scientists in India and many other things.               1.

And what was that case            about?            about?            “The longest case that I was a part of was an intellectual property matter.            The case actually began way back when I was probably in college so I was             not even a part of that case in the initial stages. When I later joined into the            profession I was transferred the case. I think it was a case of 1997 proba-             bly.”               2.

They are still in the stage of a conviction and more than            often criminals begin to exhibit remorse only upon conviction, not during           the trial.

Many forensic scientists have started their own private labs           because they cannot depend on the government labs always. Especially            when talking about analysis and experimentation. They cannot always go           to a government certified centre for their work to be completed on time.            A lot of private parties get recognition through certifications; they work           independently and at the same time aid the government and the courts in            the process.”              5.

Ms. Ann Mariya Thomas               Ms. Jocelyn Kunju John               Ms. Lorraine Tissan               Ms. Sumha Tehreem               Ms. Gayathri L Nair               Ms. Prathiksha R S             Imagine you are going back home from work. Just as you are about to turn            right, a shrill cry reaches your ears. You turn and hurry in the direction of           the sound. A little way off the road, you see a woman holding a gun and            a bleeding man on the ground. Before you could do anything the woman           shoots the man in the head twice. You catch sight of her face as she turns            but before you are noticed, you run away. It’s been one week since the in-           cident and you are on your way to the police station to identify the suspect            from a line-up. You had reported what you saw the day after it happened.           You are certain you know what she looked like. So, when asked to point            out the perpetrator, you confidently go for the woman standing on the far           left. Later, you come to know that you picked an innocent woman. Why do            you think this happened?              During trials, eyewitness accounts secure a vital role in criminal convic-           tions. Police surveys show that eyewitness testimony is the main form of            evidence in more than 20% of cases. But that doesn’t mean the evidence           is always reliable. Research shows that 75% of false convictions are caused            by an inaccurate eyewitness statement.              Further research into this area has found that eyewitness testimony can be           affected by many psychological factors:              •  Anxiety / Stress            •  Reconstructive Memory           •  Weapon Focus            •  Leading Questions (Loftus and Palmer, 1974)              “Psychologist Elizabeth Loftus has been particularly concerned with how           subsequent information can affect an eyewitness’s account of an event.           5","Her findings indicate that memory for a witnessed event is highly flexible.            If someone is exposed to new information during the interval between wit-             nessing the event and recalling it, this new information may have marked             effects on what they recall. The original memory can be modified, changed            or supplemented.               Loftus and Palmer (1974) conducted a study - Reconstruction of Automo-             bile Destruction aiming to show that leading questions could distort eye-            witness testimony accounts and so have a confabulating effect.               In this study, Loftus and Palmer (1974) asked people to estimate the speed             of motor vehicles using different forms of questions.              The estimated speed was affected by the verb used. The verb implied in-             formation about the speed, which systematically affected the participants’             memory of the accident.”              METHODOLOGY            METHODOLOGY            Two different experiments were conducted and data were collected from             both to then be compared and analysed. In both the experiments, the sub-            jects were shown a video of a crime happening and were later shown a            line-up of suspects and were questioned about what they saw in the video.             However, the perpetrator in the video was never present in the line-up.             This was done to see if the subjects would misidentify or give a correct            response.               Experiment 1: The subjects were asked - “Can you point out the suspect            Experiment 1:            that you saw in the video from the line-up?” implying that the suspect was            already there in the line-up. Their answer and the age were noted down.            The experiment was conducted on Indians and the videos shown had sus-             pects who were Caucasian.               Experiment 2: There were two different types of questioning conducted on            Experiment 2:            the subjects.             One set of subjects were asked – “Can you point out the suspect that you             saw in the video from the line-up?” implying that the suspect was already         6","there in the line-up.           Another set of subjects were asked a polar question - “Can you tell if the            suspect from the video is there in the line-up?” giving them a choice to           answer yes or no.              The answers from both sets of groups were noted down along with their            age and what they focused on when seeing the video. The experiment was           conducted on Indians and the video and photo shown had suspects who            were also Indians.              From these two experiments the questions we hoped to answer were:              1. Does the method of questioning affect the rate of misidentification?           2.

CONCLUSION             CONCLUSION             Our research was conducted to test the accuracy of eyewitness testimony.             We concluded that the polar method of questioning decreases the rate of              misidentification and people are less likely to misidentify suspects if they             are of their own race. However, in conclusion, we can reiterate that eye-              witness testimony is not reliable.                Reference:             Reference:             •  McLeod, S.

In machine learning, the fea-           tures are designed by human engineers, unlike deep learning where fea-          tures are learned from the data using general-purpose learning procedures.           For the processing of information and evidence analysis in forensic science,          this general intelligence of deep learning would be significant. With the           advancement of Modus Operandi (MO) of criminals, it has become the          need of the hour to take help of such technological and scientific methods           for the purpose of investigation of crime.             Pattern recognition and differentiation in objects through experience are          among the many tasks performed by the human brain. Machine learning,           which is the application of AI, mimics this ability of humans and enables          them to learn from experiences. Facial recognition, fingerprint matching           etc. are the application of AI for the purpose of screening and identifica-          tion of the required data, from the huge amount of data for the purpose of           the criminal justice system.               Applications of AI in FS             1. The machine-generated data will increase the objectivity in the results          of the analysis.           2. It will lead to the automation of evidence analysis by the automated          reasoning method. It will reduce the overlooking of possibilities that may           be caused by humans.          3. There will be a reduction in variations in reports due to subjectivity and           different interpretations due to different experts.          4. It has the potential to compare the low quality/degraded images as well,           by lowering the quality of “standard” to the same extent as “questioned”          13","to get the match.          5. It is possible to design algorithms that will be able to identify objects in           the video such as accidents, violent acts, robbery, criminal acts etc. This will          reduce the painstaking work of video observation for hours for the purpose           of investigations.          6. Machine learning-based systems can be used to analyze complex DNA           profiles especially in cases of admixing.          7. Through AI, it is possible to find out the number of guns firing, the ca-           liber of the gun by just audio analysis.          8. It can also be used for detecting criminal recidivism and crime forecasting           by the analysis of behaviour and pattern on social media. It can be useful to          find out the people at risk. Both processes require large amounts of data.           9. After extracting the data and analyzing it, from the given inputs like          dead bodies or objects at crime scenes, it can be used to create multiple           animated videos to help reconstruction of crime scenes.          10. Artificial intelligence would be especially helpful in tackling current           problems of cybersecurity and data security by providing robust and intelli-          gent cyber defense systems.             In the current scenario, the evidence generated using artificial intelligence           are not considered as a substitute for human decision making but just a          helping hand for the investigation of the crimes. It is considered as a Deci-           sion Support System (DSS) i.e. can be used in a trial and be used by a judge          as supportive evidence while giving a verdict but not as a substitute to evi-           dence generated by human intervention. Though AI has an exceptional and          ice-breaking potential to advance the field of forensic science, there is a           need for more research and development to realize its full potential.                                 14","BRINGING BURNT BONES                            BACK TO ‘LIFE’ USING 3D                                            TECHNOLOGY                                            A new method of presenting fragile evidence by recon-                   Ms.               structing a ‘jigsaw’ of human bone fragments using a              Yadupriya P             3D printer has been discovered by forensic scientists at                                     the University of Portsmouth.                                        The study was conducted by using fragmented burnt           human bones and testing the ability to make 3D models applicable for pre-          senting in court.             During investigation of a crime scene there is a lot of evidence such as           human remains which are damaged and fragmented and need to undergo          analysis. Physical fit analysis is a method of fitting different pieces of an ev-           idence and seeing if they are of the same whole evidence before they were          fragmented.             One of the scientists who was involved in this research said that a positive           fit indicates two or more particles have originated from the same object.          This is essential at a scene of crime to draw links between the  locations           and place of suspects at the crime scene and allow the reconstruction of the          objects. However, this is a laborious process and requires careful handling           of evidence and a keen eye since physical fit analysis depends on manually          handling the human remains and piecing together the different fragments           which would be sharp, fragile or some-          times embedded in other materials.           Dr. Brown says (one among the scien-          tists ): “We wanted to find a way to cir-           cumvent the need to manually handle          the delicate bones, so we looked to 3D           technology. Whilst the use of 3D tech-          nology has become increasingly wide-          15","spread within the field of forensics to our knowledge, this approach has not          yet been applied explicitly to physical fit analysis.”             The scientists compared two different 3D imaging techniques by using mi-           cro-computed tomography, where they utilized X-rays to see the inside          of an object slice by slice and structured light scanning. By generating vir-           tual 3D models and prints of burned human bone fragments, they tested          the suitability of these imaging techniques and subsequent 3D printing           for  analysis. The researchers ultimately found that 3D imaging and print-          ing allowed for effective analysis without excessively handling the original           fragments.             Limiting the handling of very brittle forensic evidence minimizes damage          and foulness. Moreover, the use of 3D prints opens up a possibility and the           opportunity for a jury to explore the evidence replicas. The use of  3D virtu-          al models and animations also provides 360-degree visualization in an en-           gaging, understandable, and potentially impactful way, improving a judge’s          understanding.             Dr. Brown says: “The application of 3D imaging and printing for physical fit           analysis has many advantages compared with traditional methods. Overall,          the techniques demonstrated by the study add value in forensic investiga-           tion and evidence presentation within the courtroom.”              Reference             •  ●Amber J.Collings, KatherineBrown / Forensic Science International: Reports, 2020                                16","LA-ICP-MS                  LASER ABLATION- INDUCTIVELY COUPLED                            PLASMA- MASS SPECTOMETRY                                           Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-                                       MS) is an analytical technique used to detect and                     Ms.           Lorraine Tissan            measure elements present in trace quantities from bi-                                       ological fluids, down to a detection limit of sub-parts                                      per million (ppm). This technique was discovered in                                       1980 and was first introduced in the market in the                                      year 1983. In the past decade, there has been a grad-           ually increasing shift in laboratories towards using ICP-MS instead of older          technologies like ICP AES (Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission           Spectroscopy) and flame atomic absorption. The biggest advantage ICP-          MS has over the other technologies is its multi-element capability, which           allows the measurement of multiple elements in a single analysis. Com-          bined with its short analysis time and simple sample preparation, it is high-           ly unlikely that the steady shift of technologies would cease.             However, ICP-MS can only be performed on fluids after it undergoes sam-          ple preparation. Therefore, variants of this technology have emerged that           support the spectroscopic analysis of solid samples directly. Laser Ablation          ICP-MS is the most powerful of these variants. Laser ablation is a process           by which layers are removed from a solid surface using a laser beam for          ultimate precision. When a continuous wave or pulsed laser light is focused           onto a material, its electronic subsystem and molecular lattice begin to          absorb the energy, causing atoms to dissociate from one another. These           atoms subsequently ablate, either evaporating, sublimating, or converting          directly into the plasma. These particles are then transported to the plas-           ma torch. The plasma in the ICP ionizes these particles, generating ions,          which are then extracted through the interface region and into a set of           electrostatic lenses called ion optics. The ion optics focus and guide the          ion beam into the quadrupole mass analyser. The mass analyser separates           ions according to their mass-charge ratio, and these ions are measured at          the detector. Laser Ablation ICP-MS can provide element compositions in            17","a sample with a detection limit close to parts-per-billion (ppb).             LA-ICP-MS is an elemental and isotopic microanalytical technique that has          found a place in several scientific fields, including forensic science. It can           chemically characterize physical evidence associated with a crime event, a          location, contact between objects, or contact between objects and a per-           son(s). The main forensic application of this technology is the analysis of          glass and paint samples. However, applications to other samples like docu-           ments (ink and paper), fiber, and gems have also been reported.

Hydrogen: protium,          deuterium, tritium, and Oxygen:  O, O, O are the stable isotopes of wa-                                                      18                                                                 17                                                           16          ter. The ratio of stable isotopes of water differs from the coastal region to          inland.           The heavier isotopes are seen in the coastal area while they become lighter           and lighter, moving towards the inland. The reason for this difference is           when it rains, the higher molecules like D O ( O and deuterium) fall first                                                                        18                                                                  2          near the coastal region, and when it moves inland, the D O molecule gets                                                                                       2          lower, and the H O molecule starts to fall more.                                2            The analysis of water-stable isotopes in the body helps to find the location          of each species. The body likes to build up with the help of water mole-           cules of different isotopes i.e., hydrogen and oxygen. The species near the          sea contain heavier isotopes while species in the forest have lighter ones.           The ratio between heavier and lighter molecules of water isotopes helps to          find the movement of a species from different geolocation on earth. For           example, if a species lives in hills for more than 10 years and comes to a           coastal region and lives for 5 months, the examination of the ratio of water                                                                     16                                                                                                      18          isotopes shows lighter molecules of oxygen  O than heavier oxygen  O in          the body. The analysis of water isotopes can also provide more information          about the location, habit, living conditions, etc.             The hair and nail of a species are more likely to be taken for the analysis           of water isotopes. Hair and nail leave an isotope timeline that remains          unchanged. Oxygen isotopes are incorporated into all other parts of the            19","body than hair and nail. If a person continues to travel from place to place          and drinks water, the ratio of the water isotopes in the body differs in each           fragment of the hair and nail.                                                                         SIRMS is the new technique used for the analysis of the relative abun-          dance of isotopes. Stable Isotope Ratio Mass Spectroscopy technology able           to find the relative isotopes concerning their geographical condition. The          comparison of the ratio of stable isotopes in water from different regions           gives different peaks in SIRMS. This can be compared with the ratio of the          stable isotopes in a species body to find the location of those species.                20","In a case like drowning, a homicidal drowning, or a corpse thrown to any           water body to mislead the case, the primary and secondary crime scene can          be found by water isotopes analysis when the corpus is badly decomposed          and couldn’t find any other identification details of the victim. In October           2000, some duck hunters in Utah, near the south of Great Salt Lake, found           a half-buried in a shallow grave, a plastic bag with white socks, an oversized          t-shirt, a women blue choker necklace, 12 bones, and a human skull.

The body was badly decomposed, and the           dental record didn’t reveal anything. The case went cold for 8 years until a          new technique in forensic science arrived. The scientists used Stable Iso-          tope Ratio Mass Spectroscopy (SIRMS) for analysis of the hair fragments           of Saltair sally, which revealed the person to be from the Pacific Northwest           region.

The ATM stood there magnificently, beckoning him towards      information and the reason for handling the evidence in   it, or so he imagined. A few tweaks and he had already cracked it open. He          started emptying the cassettes containing the money into his bag. Once he      a form called Chain of Custody which is usually attached   was done, he escaped the same way he came in before the guard came back       along with the packaged evidence.   from his coffee break. He left the burned open ATM box for the cops or who-           ever came in after him. A memento of him revelling in yet another successful           robbery. He made his way out of the bank without realising that he had left          something behind other than the burned open ATM box. Was it a mistake          made by a presumptuous thief or a divine intervention?                Finneas sat on his desk sipping his morning black coffee and taking a few           puffs from his cigar. It was yet another monotonous and extremely cold day          in the Greenland Sheriff’s Office. Finneas followed the same routine every           day — going to the station in the morning, enjoying his black coffee and cigar          and contemplating why he had not left this mundane job. His life as a Sheriff","was nothing like what the movies or several crime novellas put out, though          he did crave an action-packed thriller in his life. The Sheriff must maintain           law and order and fight crime. But that can only happen if there are crimes          to fight. Such was the situation in Greenland, a small town on the outskirts of           Denmark. Though having little to no crimes is a blessing, he could not say the          same thing about his job.             As he contemplated life in Greenland, he did not notice Clark walk in. Clark           was dubbed “Superman”, an obvious reference to Clark Kent. It was not just          the name that made him a perfect fit for the title. It was the glasses, the carbon           black hair and his huge build. He was also the only Sheriff in Greenland with          the highest number of cases solved and hence, he had more years of exper-           tise than anybody else in the station. Having solved the most cases was quite          something especially in a town like Greenland. Therefore, Clark did justice           to the name “Superman” in many ways. Clark had been his partner in action          from the time he transferred to Greenland and his closest friend.             Most of the hours in the station were filled, thanks to Clark and his stories           about the cases he was a part of – the man who poisoned an entire family, the          twins who dealt with drugs, the locksmith who could crack open any safe but           went too far with it, and so on.             As they sat exchanging stories the loud ringing of the station telephone stopped          them. The telephone as one can guess did not often ring and even if it did,           the news from the other side was nothing close to demanding for the cops of          Greenland, but that did not stop them from having a sliver of hope. Frank           was the one responsible for attending the telephone and once he was done          talking, everybody waited silently for him to relay the news.             “It was from Bonchester. Something about a robbery. Asked us to send two           of our seniors to help with a case.”          Bonchester was a city in Denmark and a good two hours away from Green-           land. The Bonchester police station, unlike Greenland, had its load of cases.          Clark had once done a collaborative investigation with them because of a fu-           gitive who had fled and was suspected to be hiding in Greenland.          Finneas asked the obvious question,“What does the robbery have to do with           us?” Because he was sure that Bonchester was not so scarce with manpower          that they could not deal with a robbery.","“Said the robbery is relevant to our town. Did not tell all the details. Said it           would be best to talk in person,” replied Frank.“Oh, and he did say he need-          ed Officer Kentley among the two we are sending.”           Clark’s surname was Kentley, and he went by Officer Kentley. It was not a          surprise that they needed Clark there. After a discussion, everybody agreed           on sending Finneas with Clark as they both had the most seniority, and they          were a good team.             Since they had nothing better to do, they both set out for Bonchester. After           two hours of driving and a few breaks, they finally reached Bonchester.  It          took an hour for them to finally reach the station. Clark went ahead to talk to           the officer at the desk.             “Afternoon, I am Officer Kentley from Greenland. And that’s Finneas,” he          nodded towards Finneas standing behind him.           “Ah, Officer Kentley. Officer Mikelson had been expecting you here today.”          Mads Mikelson was the leading sheriff in the Bonchester police station and           was a man in his 40s with years of expertise in the field.          They went on to his room, exchanged greetings and shook hands. Clark did           all the introducing. Mads got straight to the reason why he called them to          Bonchester.             “Hear me out Clark, this case that I called you here for, uh, well, it is a strange           one. We thought we had some leads, but it turned out to be the end of the          road. We took it lightly since it was just a robbery. Just a robbery. That is what           we all said, but now we have reasons to believe that it is not just one robbery          that this guy has committed. It might be several given the way he diligently           carried it out and left no evidence for us.”             “He goes for banks. And when you hear of ATM robberies, it’s usually the          purse snatchers and or the stolen cards that come to your mind. I have en-           countered idiots who have stolen the ATMs from banks but could not man-          age to break them open. But this guy burned open an ATM!” yelled Mads           raising his hands. “He burned open an ATM using a gas cutter, emptied it          and left it there for us.”             As Mads explained the case, Clark understood why the case was a difficult","one. The bank that was hit was in an isolated town in Bonchester. An isolated          town with a small populace means that there are not many CCTVs there. And           according to Mads, that ATM kiosk only had one CCTV camera which was          tampered with using spray paint, the usual trick. No fingerprints were recov-           ered and there were zero witnesses. What made banks like these vulnerable          was the fact that they did not have many CCTVs and a few security personnel.           The guard was the first to report the incident when he found the busted open          ATM after he got back from his morning coffee break. This concluded that           the suspect had planned when to strike and knew the time the guard went out          for his coffee. The suspect was quick in extracting the money which led the           police to think that he might have had experience in breaking into ATMs, or          he was just lucky for his first time. Since not many people lived in the town           nobody noticed anyone or any vehicle that would have been suspicious. As          Mads went on about the case, Clark noticed that Finneas had been unusually           silent the whole time. Well, he was not much of a talker in the first place but          knowing Finneas, cases like this one would have piqued his interest. By now           he would have asked Mads several questions about the case, but surprisingly          he had not said much once Mads had started.             “I have the case files right here. You both can go through them and visit           Porthouse when you are ready.” Porthouse was the town where the incident          had taken place.             “Ah, I did forget to mention why I had two of you from Greenland called           here. We did not need the extra hands. But if you remember what I said          before, I did tell you that this guy might be an expert, yes? Well, we have           reasons to believe that Porthouse is not the only place or that bank the only          one this guy has robbed. Tommy Pfilinger, one of my subordinates, worked           with me on this case. His brother-in-law, Cooper is a cop there in Copenha-          gen. And Tommy once while exchanging stories with Cooper happened to           tell him about this case while he was drunk. He got an earful from me for          that! But anyway, as Tommy told him about the robber who burned open an           ATM, Cooper stopped him halfway to tell him that he knew about a case like          that, and it was something that had left the cops of Copenhagen completely           overwhelmed. After hearing Tommy out, I decided to talk with their Sheriff          because the possibility was there and as we talked, we got to the conclusion           that we might be talking about the same guy, same case but in a different city.          Which also extended the possibility that he might have done this somewhere","else too. We have sent out notices to different stations in Denmark regarding          this. That is when I remembered you, Clark. I remember when you came           here to work with us on that fugitive case, you told me about that robbery in          your town that happened like a few years ago, and how the cops were not able           to find the guy who did it. I asked around some folks I knew in Greenland          and those who knew about the case told me that some cop named Henrik was           leading the investigation at that time.”             Clark froze for a minute as the realization hit him. Clark remembered that          case. It was 2 years ago, but he was not part of the case. Now he knew why           Finneas was quiet. Finneas Henrik. That was his friend’s full name. And that          robbery from 2 years ago was one of Finneas Henrik’s biggest shame.             Finneas still remembered that case. Every nuance of it was etched into his           brain. As he went out for a walk, Clark explained the situation to Mads. Mads          was right. “It was just a robbery.” That is what even he thought initially, but           it turned out to be one of his biggest failures. Finneas looked up at the sky          wondering about fate. After 2 years, that case had come to haunt him. He did           not believe in the existence of a God, but this fateful encounter with his past          made him question the divine. Finneas went back inside the station. Though           the investigation of this case was anticlimactic 2 years ago, Finneas was deter-          mined this time. “This time, I have got to make things right,” he whispered as           he walked back.             The three of them sat to exchange information about the case. Finneas re-          vealed what he knew and learned from the case. At first, they thought it would           have been an ex-employee who had a bad history with the bank, but they          could not navigate anyone like that. The only evidence that they were able           to find from the kiosk was the needle of a lock picker. It had a blue handle          and a design carved on it.  But that did not get them anywhere since it was           evident that the suspect used a gas cutter to burn through the ATM. Finneas          and Clark along with Mads decided to work the case. It was still too early to           conclude that the robberies were connected, but the three of them did not          want to give up the possibility.             For the next few weeks, Mads, Clark and Finneas along with Cooper discussed           the case. The ATM was busted open using a gas cutter, and it was done care-          fully so as to not hinder the cassettes of cash inside. The suspect entered the","building from above and would target kiosks that were lightly guarded and          dilapidated. Since the ATMs were old, they did not have trigger alarms or           any countermeasures if someone broke into them. The CCTV footage inside          the kiosks of all three towns showed the same thing — A hand holding a spray           can and then blank footage. It was a gloved hand and at the part where the          glove ended, there was a small curve of ink on his wrist, giving the smallest           glimpse of a tattoo. But the image was way too pixelated to get a lead. And it          was impossible to find a man just by using the small curve of his tattoo. Later,           the footage from Copenhagen confirmed that they spotted a small curvature          of the tattoo in the hand that was caught on their CCTV. This reaffirmed the           connection with at least two of the robberies.             Cops were able to conclude that he stood at the camera’s blind spot to apply          the paint. This also meant that he had visited the kiosks before the robberies           to case the joint. The police also tried to navigate his expenditure by trying to          track the banknotes, using their serial numbers and asking shops nearby, but           that was a dead-end too. Besides, it was unseemly that someone as meticulous          as this thief would be too careless to spend the stolen money nonchalantly.           And there was also the fact that he hit 3 places as far as they knew — Green-          land, Copenhagen and Bonchester in that order. All these three towns were           quite far from each other; hence, it was difficult to locate where this man          might have been from. All they knew was that he was ready to travel for hours           to survey the banks first and then steal the money. He went for old and worn-          out ATMs which relatively had lesser money than the other new and updated           ATMs. The money stolen from the three kiosks each was roughly estimated          to be between 10,000 – 30,000 kroner.           Finneas along with the three others worked on the case and contacted several          police stations to find out if any old ATM kiosks were hit. The period be-           tween each robbery was random, erratic and did not have a consistent pattern.             The four of them worked for hours to study the case but did not find any          leads to the case. They all decided to visit the three kiosks one by one on           three different days, keeping Greenland for last since it was further away.          Mads and Cooper went along with Clark to Riverton in Greenland where the           ATM kiosk was. Finneas did not need to go since the image of the kiosk was          still fresh in his mind. But that was not the reason he did not go.           That day was when Jon the locksmith was coming to his house to check his          door locks which were jammed. Jon was the best in town and Finneas would","not settle for anyone else other than Jon. He watched Jon skillfully using his          pick lock and one of the hooks to open the jammed lock. Jon was a talker           and Finneas ignored him almost all the time, but he did his job well. “Also,          sire, I won’t be here for the next few months. I have made some big plans for           myself,” he said grinning. “But I can get another guy who can do this work          as well as me. His name is Markus. He tends to travel around a lot, but he is           thorough with his work. Poor thing, he had to struggle to find a living because          of his thief of a father,” Jon went on. While Jon kept jabbering, Finneas was           thinking about matters that he could look for in the case, things that he might          have overlooked 2 years ago.             He decided to survey Riverton and the CCTV footage that were available           nearest to the kiosk.              Thanks to Cooper and Mads he was able to acquire CCTV footage from and          near the kiosks and stacked the CDs to take it home and look through them           thoroughly. Finneas spent the next few days looking through the CDs of the          footage, to look for any suspicious vehicles since the suspect needed a vehicle           to cover the long distances. This went on for two weeks, him trying to stay up          late at night and trying to find any piece of evidence or lead from footage that           went back two months before the robbery. Some nights, his eyes gave in, and          he fell asleep, but then he slapped himself awake, drank tons of black coffee           and got back to work. Clark had lent him a desktop, and he had a laptop and          computer with him, so he sat and watched three monitors simultaneously           and took notes at the same time. He talked to Clark on the phone and was          frustrated about how he had wasted his time and slept on nothing. Clark re-           assured him saying “Now we have one less thing to look into,” and directed          him to sleep so that they could work on something else the next morning.           Finneas was about to give up and get to sleep, but he decided to spend an-          other hour on the footage. “Just to make sure,” he said to himself. Finneas           struggled to keep his eyes open, look through all the three monitors and take          notes at the same time. As he watched the screens something white flashed           in his periphery. It was from one of the screens on his left. He went back in          the footage to see if he was not hallucinating. He was not. He saw a white van.           He slapped himself again so that he could focus and remember the reason          why the white van seemed so familiar to him. This footage was the one from           Bonchester, from a street that was near the kiosk which was in Port House.          His hands were fumbling in excitement and confusion as he tried to grab the","notebook and flip through his notes. When he was taking notes on footage          of Greenland from two weeks before the robbery, he had scribbled down ‘a           white van’ which passed by the post office that was a kilometre away from the          kiosk in Riverton. Though he did not at first pay much attention to it, he went           back to the footage in Riverton and found the same white van. He spotted it          again from the footage on the day of the robbery. He could not contain his           excitement and wanted to jump, but he was too tired to do so.             It was 4:00 am, and he decided to sleep for two hours and woke up at 6:00 am          to look through the footage sent by Copenhagen to check for the white van.           After 3 hours of looking and not being able to find the white van, he decided          to take the CDs to the station and search with the three of them. Soon they           were able to spot the recurring appearance of the white van near all 3 kiosks.             Once they were able to produce a prominent image of the white van, they          were able to conclude that it was a Ford Transit 350.  “The guys are still work-           ing on the serial number. They were able to tell 3 out of the 6 figures in the          number plate, but they said they needed some more time,” Mads announced,           “A Ford Transit of that version is not common here even among traders and          employers. So, it should be easier to track the owner.”           Finneas hoped the van would pave out more leads for them, but he could not          rest now. He needed to look more. Anything that would help them find that           elusive bastard. He went through the case file of the Riverton robbery which          he had failed to solve. He went through the pages, his hands gliding across           the images of the kiosk, the broken ATM and the one useless evidence they          were able to find —  the lock picker. His eyes widened suddenly. “How could           I have overlooked this? Why didn’t I think of this sooner?” he started mut-          tering to himself as he tried to focus and remember. Clark, who was sitting           across from him, was concerned. “I need to go out quickly,” Finneas stormed          off before Clark could stop him.             It had been a few hours since Finneas had rushed out of the station, and he           was not answering Clark’s calls. Mads walked in to reveal that the License          plate number of the white van was confirmed, and his men were able to find           workshops and rentals that sold a Ford Transit 350.             There was a rental in a town in Greenland, so Clark headed there. In the          phone, the man who ran the rental had told him that he remembered selling","a Ford but was not sure if it was the van they were looking for.             A few hours later, around 9:00 pm, Finneas had finally called Clark back. He          said he had to meet with him. They agreed to meet at the café near the Green-           land station. As Finneas entered the café, he spotted Clark gesturing towards          his table where he was sitting with Cooper. “Finn, we got some good news,           I was just telling Cooper about what we were able to find out from the white          van. We were able to locate the van’s origin in a rental here in Greenland.           The man said he had registered the van under the name ‘Markus Nielsen’. I          have some of our men in Greenland looking into him right now. Mads should           be here within an hour or two.”             “I think I know where to find him. The guy you are looking for,” Finneas said          slowly.           “Huh? Did you hear from Mads?” Cooper asked, confused.          “Or is it someone you know, Finn?” asked Clark.             “Not exactly. But I was able to find him thanks to you Clark,” Finneas smiled.           Clark’s bewilderment grew even more as Finneas continued “Remember that          one case you mentioned in your stories, the one about the locksmith who           could crack open any safes? His name was Thomas Suzack. He stole an          ATM, loaded it into a vehicle and fled. Later police found him trying to pick           the lock of the ATM, but he failed. A witless effort.” Clark’s eyes widened          in recognition. “Thomas was jailed for an attempt at theft. He did not serve           much time and was out soon. But he died 2 years after that. He had a son.          Since his father’s name had received quite the fame, he did not want anything           to do with it. His name was ‘Markus Suzack’ which he later changed to -”             “Markus Nielsen,” said both Cooper and Clark unanimously.           Jon Frueger was Finneas’ trusted locksmith. Jon was a talker, but he did his           work well. Finneas cursed himself for not seeing something that was staring          right at his face. The lock pick that was found in the first robbery had a blue           handle with a pattern carved into it. When he was going through the case file          today, he could feel déjà vu when he saw the photo of the lock picker. That is           when he remembered Jon. Jon, the locksmith who used lock pickers to fix his          locks. Lock pickers that were just like the one found after the robbery. And           Jon the talker who told him about a certain co-worker of his, Markus, who          liked to travel. “One good thing that came out of Jon’s usual banters, aye?”","Finneas laughed and sighed.             The lock pickers were like a company badge given to the locksmiths. Since          Greenland only had one such locksmithing business, the lock pickers were           the same for all the locksmiths in the city. But having the same lock picks and          a father with a thieving history was not conclusive enough, was it? Finneas           called Jon to ask him the question that he had been afraid to think about.          Everything depended on the answer he was going to get. “Does Markus have           a tattoo? Maybe somewhere on his wrist.”             “That he does, sire.” Finneas was buoyed with relief. “It is a small one. A          snake swallowing its tail. That’s what he told me it was.” That explains the           small curvature they were able to spot on the suspect’s wrist. Jon further pro-          ceeded to tell him about how he wanted a tattoo of Darth Vader on one of his           arm muscles and maybe one of Jesus on his calves. Finneas hung up before          Jon could go on about it.           Within a few hours, they were able to convince the Magistrate for a search          warrant thanks to the persuasiveness of three Sheriffs. Since they were sus-           pecting that Markus might be hiding the stolen money either where he lived          or somewhere he often frequents, their objective now was to find any evidence           that would incriminate him. Finneas and Clark went ahead to where Markus          lived, a small rental flat. Finneas could not wait to confront the person who           had put him through a circuitous journey for the past 3 years.             Markus was shocked to see two Sheriffs at his door but regained his compo-          sure very quickly. Clark explained to him about the search warrant and how           he was a suspect for multiple robberies in Denmark. Markus tried to put          forth an unerringly confident façade but Finneas could see that he was tense.           “Mr Nielsen, please stretch out both your hands,” ordered Finneas. As Fin-          neas unveiled Markus’ long sleeve he saw the tattoo on his left wrist. It was           just like what Jon said, “A snake swallowing its tail and a small one.” Finneas          reminded himself to treat Jon to how many ever tattoos he wanted after this           was over. Finneas had questioned Markus on where he was during the time of          the robbery and weeks before the robbery when Finneas had found Markus’           white van lurking in the streets near the kiosks. He responded saying that he          did not remember where he was.             After hours of searching Markus’ place from tile to tile, they were not able","to find anything. Finneas found himself getting frustrated and completely dis-          heartened as he kept searching. Now all he could hope for was that Cooper           and Mads were able to find some lead in Markus’ workplace. And if they          could not find a lead…... No! He did not want to go down that lane again. He           felt a hand on his shoulder and turned to see Clark “I think it’s time to leave,          Finn,” he sounded tired and dejected.             “I can assure you, officer, I was not in any of the places during the time that           you mentioned right now. There was nothing to find here because I am not          hiding anything here,” he curtly said.             Finneas scanned the room for one last time and saw Markus’s bookshelf. The           cops looked around it but did not find anything. Markus had quite the collec-          tion of books. It seemed like he was a collector of Holy Scriptures, especially           The Bible. He had different Bibles varying in different sizes and different          colours too. It looked like Markus was a devout Christian. But even if that was           the case why these many? The verses in a Bible tend to vary but, in the end,          the message was still the same in all of them. Finneas found it odd. “Quite the           collection of Bibles you got here. You like to hoard ‘em?’ asked Finneas.             “Yes, that and my family were orthodox, they lived for God and lived by the          Bible. And I imbibed those values.”             Finneas would have left then and there, and Markus would have avoided           getting caught, yet again, if it were not for the smallest mishap Markus made.          Finneas knew Markus was tense, he also knew that in times of danger people           tend to lean towards things they want to protect. And that is what Markus did.          He gave the smallest glance toward the thing he wanted to protect the most in           that room. The Bibles. Why though?             Finneas walked slowly toward the shelf, he could feel Markus getting a little          edgy. Finneas took out one of the Bibles from the shelf and started flipping           through the pages. When he reached a book called Isaiah, he saw that instead          of the pages filled with verses, there was a rectangular space carved out by cut-           ting out the pages and in them were stacked, a bundle of kroner banknotes.

She           was last seen on 31st January 2013, in Cecil Hotel,            Los Angeles, California where she had checked in a           few days before she went missing. Elisa started her            journey from San Diego in California to Los Angeles.           She had planned to check out on the 31st of January            and travel to Santa Cruz. She always wanted to travel           around the US, and she had been constantly contact-            ing her parents, telling them about her adventures.           After the 31st of January, the relatives reported her            missing to the police since they did not get any infor-           mation about her.              On 19th February 2013, as per complaints of Cecil’s guests about the water            tasting weird and having dark colour, a maintenance guy checked the water           tanks on the rooftop of the hotel. Elisa Lam was found dead in one of the            tanks, where she was found floating naked. She had been lying there for at           least 2 weeks. In June 2013, Los Angeles County Coroner’s office ruled the            death accidental due to drowning, and the autopsy result confirmed that           there was no trace of drugs in her system.              The footage released by the security camera placed on the Cecil hotel’s el-            evator shows the last minutes of Elisa before facing her death. Her behav-           iour was the subject of numerous speculations and analysis. Body language            experts confirmed that she manifested anxiety and stress and even looked           playful and excited at some point.              In her blog, she mentioned that she was on medication. Her prescription            suggested that she suffered from bipolar disorder, which was later con-           firmed by the LAPD and autopsy report. One thing to be noticed in the            35","case is that she had been sharing her room with another person when she            checked in. After two days, the front desk got a call complaining about           Elisa’s odd behaviour, and they felt discomfort in staying with her. Later            on, Elisa was moved to another single room, and this floor was not under           CCTV surveillance.              She once wrote on her Tumblr: “Would I become psychotic and want to off            myself? I doubt that very, much yes there is a huge risk that will happen.           I wouldn’t do anything rash like actually jump off a high bridge, I’m too            much of a coward. Instead, I will just lie in my bed and let the days pass by.           That’s my physical manifestation sleeping for days in my bed.”              THEORIES BEHIND HER DEATH           THEORIES BEHIND HER DEA                    TH                 BIPOLAR           •  •  BIPOLAR DISORDER: Elisa Lam was mentally ill, and she used to take                             DISORDER:               antidepressants, antipsychotics, and mood stabilizers. According to the               toxicology report, on the day of her missing, she had taken antidepres-                sants and not the other medicines. Antidepressants alone can cause se-               vere mania, inducing symptoms like hallucination, delusion, paranoia,                catatonia, and lack of insight.

The Elevator Game is a ritual that originated on a Korean               website. When performed properly, you can supposedly be transported               to another dimension. After her death, the footage                of the elevator went viral, and that showed Elisa act-               ing very oddly in it, pressing random buttons, talking                to seemingly nobody. This raised suspicions that she               was playing the Elevator Game.              MYSTERIES BEHIND THE CECIL HOTEL-           MYSTERIES BEHIND THE CECIL HOTEL-           The Cecil Hotel is a budget hotel in Downtown Los           Angeles, built in 1924. The hotel has a checkered histo-            ry, with many suicides and deaths occurring there. The           first case was reported on January 22, 1927 - a suicide            attempt by Percy Ormand Cook. Subsequently, there        36","were many more suicidal attempts and deaths, one among them being the            missing case of Elisa Lam.              The serial killer, Richard Ramirez, infamously called “The Night Stalker”,           guilty of killing 40 women during the ‘80s, had been living in this hotel.            Also, the Austrian prostitute serial killer from Vienna, Jack Unterweger,           stayed at the hotel, where he committed several homicides.

The evidences found were:            The evidences found were:            •  A water bottle fallen down near the fridge with dripping water.             •  Veil found underneath the exit door.            •  The exit door was closed from outside and the latches inside were un-                 latched.            •  An axe which had fallen down.             •  A basket which had fallen down.            •  Two slippers of Abhaya were found at different places – one found un-                 derneath the fridge and another found near the well.            •  Lacerated wound on the right side of the back of the head which was                 one of the injuries found on the body after the autopsy.               After investigating the case, the local police and crime branch ruled it as            suicide, with the cause of death as drowning. CBI took over the case after             a petition signed by 67 nuns belonging to Abhaya’s congregation asked to            investigate the case as a homicide. CBI wrote 3 reports stating – 1. They             could not determine whether it was a suicide or homicide 2. Homicide but           38","could not identify the perpetrators 3. No one was involved in Abhaya’s            death. Each one of the reports was rejected by the High court, asking for           further probing and investigation. Once the case was transferred to the CBI            Kochi unit in 2008, following the failed investigations of previous agencies,           three accused namely – Father Thomas Kottoor, Father Jose Poothrikayil,            and Sister Sephy were arrested. Though they got bail in January 2009, they           were charged with murder, destruction of evidence, and defamation in July            2009 in the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Ernakulam.              After the release petition filed by the three accused in 2011 was rejected by           Thiruvananthapuram CBI in 2018, and Father Poothrikkayil was let off due            to inadequate evidence of him being present in the crime scene, Fr. Kottoor           and Sr. Sephy faced a murder trial in CBI special court, Thiruvananthapu-            ram. Though the case went on for 28 years, justice was finally served on           23rd December 2020 when Fr. Kottoor and Sr. Sephy were awarded life            imprisonment and fine for murder and an additional seven years of impris-           onment for tampering with evidence.            Strengthening the prosecution side of the case was tough as 8 out of 49           witnesses turned hostile once the trial started and retracted their state-            ments which provided evidence of Fr. Kottoor’s presence in the location           of crime on the day of the murder. The 2 testimonies which were used as            strong evidence were given by –              1.

Kottoor in the               convent when he entered the convent to steal something on the day of                the crime.              Other evidences which strengthened the prosecution’s side were:           Other evidences which strengthened the prosecution’s side were:           •  The injury on Abhaya’s head was said to be sufficient enough to cause                death.           •  Inmates of the convent attested that Sister Abhaya would not have com-                mitted suicide as she was leading a happy life.           39","•  The cook at the convent said that the dogs guarding the gate did not                bark on the day of the murder, which implies that the intruders were               regular visitors (Fr. Kottoor and Fr. Poothrikayil).             •  Fr.

She then accidentally finds Fr. Kottoor, Fr.            Poothrikayil, and Sr. Sephy in a ‘compromising position’. Afraid of being             caught, Sr. Sephy hits Abhaya with an axe while Fr. Kottoor was holding            Sr. Abhaya. Once she was dead, all the three accused dumped her body in             the well, hoping that it would destroy all evidence. Even after manipulating            officers to change the reports to suicide and to tamper with evidence, the             accused get caught after 28 long years and appropriate punishment was            given to them.

The police reached            the site upon receiving information from the resort staff. It was then that           the  Maoist  group  began  firing  indiscriminately  across  the  commandos,            which resulted in a series of counter firing, in which Jaleel was shot dead.              The IGP (Inspector-General of Police), Balram Kumar Upadhyay, furnished           the following details to the media:            1. None of the personnel involved in the encounter was injured.           2. Another person in the armed gang of Maoists was injured, evident from            the trail of blood picked up.           3. The crime scene was cordoned off, and combing operations were under-            way.           4. Jaleel was an active member of the ultra-group for the past five to six            years, having cases registered against him in 2014 and 2016.              However, what the resort manager and another employee had was a differ-           ent tale. As per their witness statements, Jaleel and another headed into            the reception and urged them for food and money. The resort manager also             41","inferred that the place could have been under police surveillance, which            was why the force rushed to the resort, and the encounter took place. The            resort employees indicated that it was the police and not the Maoists who           fired first.              The CCTV footage more or less supported the resort manager’s version of            the story. Owing to the different information given by the police and the           resort owners, speculations of a fake encounter began surfacing.           The inquest report dated 8th March 2019 revealed three bullets were pres-            ent in Jaleel’s body, with one of the bullets penetrating from the back of            his head to the front, which proved fatal. Apart from this, the following           items were retrieved from near the body:           1. A conventional firearm            2. Eight bullets            3. A detonator             The forensic ballistics report came out on 28th September 2020, strength-            ening the doubt on the police operation. The report revealed that the fire-            arm, allegedly belonging to Jaleel, was not fired on the very day. Also, the           swab from Jaleel’s right hand showed no gunshot residue.              The police immediately set out to clarify the findings, stating that though            no gunshot residue was found from the right hand, metal lead was detect-           ed from the left hand and that the two empty cartridges found at the crime           scene did not match with any of the weapons forwarded for examination.            They further indicated the necessity to examine the firearms of those Mao-            ists who managed to escape from police.             Jaleel’s family believed that the shots were deliberate. C. P. Rasheed and            C.P Jishad, Jaleel’s brothers, claimed the police could have shot below the            waist if needed. Jishad laid stress on the forensic report, claiming how gun-           shot residue was not found from the swab, with Jaleel being right-handed.           A magisterial inquiry launched after the rise of allegations predominant-            ly supported the police version. Nevertheless, Jaleel’s family and human            rights activists claimed the inquiry report gave a clean chit to the police and           demanded a judicial inquiry. The inquiry did not put weight on the forensic         42","findings, which was a reason to believe that it favoured the government.           The deceased’s family and other human rights activists have moved with            complaints to the SP (Superintendent of Police) and an indefinite hunger            strike.           The idea of Maoism does not appeal to the government’s interest. But,           it certainly does not entrust the right to take the lives of Maoists unless            deemed necessary. The “necessary” situation could refer to a threat or dan-            ger to the public. The police do mention how the Maoists had begun firing,           which led to the retaliatory firing. As of now, not much evidence supports           the statements made by the police. This, in turn, has raged the family and            other human rights activists.            The encounter remains dubious due to the absence of a thorough inves-           tigation taking all scientific aspects into account. Human rights activists           focus on the possibility of previous such “encounters” being fictitious.             Myth - Only a complete fingerprint is useful     for matching a person to it.         Fact - Even a small part of the fingerprint     can be used to match a person using the      minutiae characteristics in a fingerprint.

Around 70 people were discharged from            the hospital after their condition became stable. A 45-year old man from           Vidyanagar and a 30-year old woman from South Street in Eluru report-            edly died. However, the doctors have not yet confirmed the cause of their           death.              The condition of five patients, including a six-year-old girl, who was shifted            to the Government General Hospital in Vijayawada, was stated to be sta-           ble. Consumption of contaminated water was suspected to be the reason            behind the sudden hospitalisations, but officials clarified that they were           awaiting the results of the water samples sent for analysis. COVID-19 tests            were conducted on all the people admitted to the hospital, and they have           tested negative. Blood and CSF (Cerebrospinal fluid) samples were col-            lected and sent for testing. CT scans were also done. Chief Minister YS           Jagan Mohan Reddy visited Eluru on Monday, directing the health officials            to make every effort to ensure the recovery of the people affected by the           illness and find out the reason behind it at the earliest. Eluru Superinten-            dent Mohan Rao said, “All the patients are being given emergency medi-           cal treatment, and 80 per cent of them are stable. They were admitted to            the hospital after convulsions and mild headaches. In several cases, they           fainted after vomiting. Some of them had bone dislocations and muscu-         44","lar pains. Epidemiology and Microbiology experts from Vijayawada went            to Eluru to ascertain the cause of the illness. Services of psychiatrists and             psychologists were also used to counsel the patients as several of them             are distressed”. Some of the discharged patients said they did not know            what happened to them, and they were informed later that they had bouts            of convulsions. Most of them said they consumed tap water as usual and             started vomiting before fainting.               Assumptions:            Assumptions:              Vomiting, headache, and seizures among patients in Eluru are not related             to the sequence of symptoms of any known disease, say medical experts.            There may be chances of encephalitis, but again the initial sequence of            symptoms does not match as well. In some cases, the patients fainted first             and then frothed.               Waterborne disease symptoms:            Waterborne disease symptoms:            •  Vomiting             •  Stomachache             •  Headache            •  Seizure               The Actual Cause:            The Actual Cause:              Eluru has a great water system having lakes which were inhabited by fish-            es. Due to floods and severe pollution in the lakes, the fishes suffered             disease and their wastage in the lakes led to this illness. The lake water             interfered with the drinking water, and the same water was used for agri-            culture where the crop and yield developed the organic elements in them.            This has caused people to suffer from an unknown disease. Nickel has been             found in the samples of blood, urine, and stool as well as from milk, rice,             dal, vegetables, pesticides, soil, and water too.              Investigation:            Investigation:               The All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, found traces of lead           45","and nickel in blood samples of 25 victims from the 45 samples sent by the           Government. Public health experts and scientists from various agencies            are waiting for detailed reports of analysis of blood and water samples, but            the primary suspicion is that of water contamination by heavy metals. Sci-           entists suspect pesticide or insecticide to have seeped into drinking water           sources.               The district administration and Eluru Municipal Corporation officials had           also investigated this case and found that Eluru receives water through           canals from both Godavari and Krishna rivers. The canals pass through ag-            ricultural fields where runoff laced with pesticides mixes with water in the            canals. Many aspects of the mystery illness have baffled scientists. People           who only use packaged drinking water have also fallen sick.             Who was involved in the investigation?           Who was involved in the investigation?             While AIIMS, New Delhi, has tested blood, water, and milk samples for           heavy metals, the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) Hy-            derabad, is testing for pathogens. The National Institute for Nutrition, Hy-            derabad, had tested samples of urine, blood, water vegetables, fruits and           other consumables for traces of heavy metals and pesticides. The Indian           Institute of Chemical Technology is testing water and blood samples for            traces of pesticides.              While lead and pesticides continue to be concentrated upon, forensic toxi-           cologists and chemists were given significant preference for further inves-            tigations. Investigations pertaining to other pathogens and probable sourc-            es are also being carried out.             Conclusion:           Conclusion:              Forensic toxicology is an es-           sential  component  of  vari-           ous medical and legal inves-            tigations.  The  field  covers            numerous crimes involving         46","adulterations and poisons. It has played a good role in this case. Further             development in the forensic field would help make a better society.                  “THE EVIDENCE CANNOT BE INTIMIDATED. IT DOES NOT FORGET.

In return, payment was made in bitcoins. “Through tactics, techniques, and            procedures, the theft was ultimately linked to Hidden Cobra, a threat actor           with ties to North Korea. While not too technically advanced, this attack            was executed with military precision, taking advantage of common security           weaknesses found in many start-ups, resulting in an unprecedented finan-            cial theft.”              Before going further, we should now understand some terms like Crypto-           currency and Social Engineering.              Cryptocurrency:           Cryptocurrency: “A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is           secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit           or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based            on blockchain technology—a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate           network of computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they            are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theo-           retically immune to government interference or manipulation”. Some of            the examples of cryptocurrency are Bitcoin, Basic Attention Token (BAT),           Ethereum, etc.              Social Engineering:           Social Engineering:  “Social engineering is the act of tricking someone into           divulging information or acting, usually through technology. The idea be-           hind social engineering is to take advantage of a potential victim’s natural            tendencies and emotional reactions. To access a computer network, the           typical hacker might look for a software vulnerability. A social engineer,            though, could pose as a technical support person to trick an employee into           divulging their login credentials. The fraudster is hoping to appeal to the         48","employee’s desire to help a colleague and, perhaps, act first and think lat-             er.”               Attack Methodology            Attack Methodology            The first line of attack was through social engineering. The threat actor             pretended to be a company employee, specifically one of the system en-             gineers. The e-mail exactly mimicked an invitation from cloud service and            was pretending to appear as sort of a weekly report. Given the impersonat-            ed sender’s actual role within the company, this wasn’t only expected, but             the specified document.               They used servers that allow them to send an e-mail anonymously, which            is how they managed to defeat the Security Protection Factor (SPF) within             the place to stop the victim’s domain from being spoofed.               Several links inside the email body, including the one to just accept the  in-            vitation, had been replaced with bit.ly shortened URLs. But all the servers             were down at the time of the investigation.               When the target clicked the primary link, the link triggered a download of            a .zip file, and inside that zip file were two more files named “Password.             txt.lnk”: the “weekly_report.doc” file was password protected which made             the target more convinced that files are genuine.              The string is executed as a script (see Appendix 2) which connects to a             different server that requests to send the “main.cs” file, which got decod-             ed from Base64 so it got passed as a script block. This script or the initial            download file wasn’t retrieved on the filesystem; however, at the same            time, the Event Log started showing messages containing parts of Pow-             erShell code (channel Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational, event             ID 4104). Pieced together, this code was found to perform several tasks:              • Writes a long string, which decodes to a script, to the user’s APPDATA             followed by “\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\appView.             js”;             49","• Gets some “base information” (computer name, network configuration,             the OS details, the list of open ports, and the Internet settings) and trans-             mits these to the attacker using the C2 server; and connects to a C2 server            and retrieve actions to perform, including               • “Kill”/”Stop”(same command);               • “Execute” which downloads a payload and inserts it into a PE file using            PEInjection() function; and “DownExec”, this last one downloads a file,             decodes it, and executes it directly.

Most of the logs used to reconstruct the activity were retrieved             from servers. The company that hosted the data centre and operated the            VPN failed to retain all the logs for the VPN concentrator. Using stolen            credentials, the attacker connected to the data center VPN and using the             stolen SSH key, to one of the servers hosting the API server and also the             BitGo proxy server for the company. The attacker went straight for this            server, indicating that he/she had an extremely good understanding of the            company’s infrastructure, possibly due to the documents retrieved from             the target’s computer.

But it           would be a lie. I meant to kill her, and I loved every minute of it. You might          consider me to be some form of a monster. Some creature who killed a poor          girl in an archaic and cruel way but that would be another lie, you would only           be lying to yourself, though, as it will never change the fact that I was once a           detective, a brilliant detective, and you refuse to believe it.            It all started with the case, my final case. I had begun the investigation and I           simply could not come to terms with the barbarity of the murder. The man           had been discarded on the floor, his hands and feet had been cut off to pre-          vent escape. It was horrible, I had never seen anything like it. The ill-fated man          must have died in agony as he bled to death. The killer had left no evidence.           My team was stumped, how were we to catch a killer without any evidence?             As the days passed, we were at a standstill. The image of the body was still          piercing my mind then. Blood had been streaked across the room as he ob-              viously had tried to get help. The phone had rung, and my team and I had          Myth - Evidence containing blood or other fluids    sprung to action. But there had been no good news, no information on the           should be packed in a plastic bag.  killer. It had been another murder.            We had raced to the scene, a dark, misty forest. It was the middle of the          Fact - Evidences which contain moisture are supposed    night and my team and I were on the edge. I felt my heart pumping as we ap-           to be air dried in shade and packed in a paper bag.   proached the scene. It was worse than the previous murder. The young girl,           Packing wet evidence in plastic will not let air circulation             around the age of nineteen, had been tied to a large oak tree. Her scalp had           and will lead to the evidence being contaminated by   been partially removed and blood was seeping down her forehead. Clumps          bacteria and fungi.  of hair had been cast on the dirt ground beside her lifeless form. As I had           examined the body, I had discovered the murder weapon, a silver kitchen          knife. Attached to the weapon was a note, the note had read “My gift to you           - X”. Upon examination of the previous body, we were convinced that both           murders had been committed by this ‘X’.            The indentations of the cuts on the bodies indicated that she had used the","same knife.             Then, there was one final body. It was a young girl of only twelve. We had          found what was left of her body across town on a deserted farm. She had been           burnt alive. That image will always remain in my mind. I always imagined that          if you were burnt alive, you would probably just turn to ash, but this wasn’t the           case. Her body still retained form, her skin charred and black, sections of it          peeled off of her body. The ambulance said she hadn’t died immediately. She           had been here for a few days as the fire didn’t kill her. She eventually died of          a combination of hyperthermia and septic shock. A note had been left on the           scene, signed by ‘X’ caused so much pain and so much suffering. The search          had driven me insane. No more murders had occurred, and there was no ev-           idence to identify the murderer. My team had dropped the case and moved          on, but I couldn’t. I searched on for days after, those days had turned into           weeks and the weeks into months.             My boss had fired me by this point and my doctor declared me “unfit for          duty”. But still, I searched on. Eventually, I identified the killer. Her name           was Jenica Amalita and she had lived in Cuba. Upon this discovery, I called          my former team, I thought that they would be happy with me, that they would           say congratulations and arrest the criminal. But, instead, they said my evi-          dence was “...illegitimate...” and that I”...couldn’t possibly bring her to trial..”.           I knew that I was right. I couldn’t have been wrong, could I?             They hung up on me, leaving me to ferment in my misery. I was determined          to bring the filth to justice, but I needed a plane ticket to Cuba and I was des-           titute. I finally decided that I would sell my apartment and all my belongings          to pay for the ticket. Day after I owned nothing, hours later I was on a plane           to Cuba. When I arrived, I immediately began mapping her whereabouts,          there was no time for jet lag. I was able to determine she was at home, alone.           Brandishing a kitchen knife, I broke in the dead of night, sweat dripping off          of my forehead, I dragged her out of her bed. She tried to scream, but I had           already gagged her and tied her to a chair. The situation had felt so surreal.          After years of searching, losing my job and falling below the poverty line be-           cause I was so consumed, I had finally found her and I knew what I had to do          if the law would not serve justice, I would.             Mimicking her first murder, I began to cut off her feet and hands, her eyes","pleading for mercy. I knew she was in agony, and I relished it. I stood there          for a few moments, admiring my work. She was suffering like her victims had           suffered.             A smile creeping around my lips, I was ecstatic, it was almost over. I watched          happily as her eyes felt lifeless. I watched hungrily as her body slowly fell to-           ward death. I watched calmly as the colour drained from her skin. I watched          silently through the night and into the next morning as the final few drops of           blood escaped her body.            Her mother came home and screamed in horror. Knife still in hand, I only          stopped watching when the police came to arrest me.             Dragging me out of the house!            The smell of decay in my nostrils.             All I wanted to do was watch.             And now I am here, giving my confession. Although I don’t need to, it’s pretty           obvious I killed her. Whatever my sentence, I don’t care. I did my job, I did          what I had to do.

With the advent of technology and the recent developments            in the field of information technology, we require a very strong system             of what we are doing using this technology so that we will be safe and             we will not be vulnerable to any sort of criminal activity. Every day there            is some new technology that is developed. New software, new websites,            new games, new applications, new reveries of computers and mobile             phones, a new type of communication among many others are developing             at a rate that cannot be comprehended.  In this digital framework, many            of us cannot live without our phone or devices for even ten minutes. For            our everyday life, we look for some form of technology that is there to be             of some assistance. A very simple example would be a smartwatch that             is gaining more importance than other watches and ultimately becomes a            part of the Internet of things (IoT). All of these systems, all of this soft-            ware and application that we are using day in and day out, are handling             some amount of data if not all the data. Any type of device you may use             will be processing some data or the other. The question is - what data is            being handled by that system or interface and what happens to the data            once the job is done? It is surprising to see many do not know the nuances             of these processes?               An example of an application that could properly help you communicate            with other people. Using the same application you are not only able to             message them but also video chat with them using the internet. There are             numerous applications available for performing these functions, but we            do not know the source of these applications or the owner of these appli-            cations. Maybe we would be able to say that this application is owned by             this particular entity, but we cannot say that for all the applications that             we would be using. Take your mobile phone, for example, you would have            installed applications on the phone, that you don’t use anymore, or you           59","just wanted to try. For such applications to function, certain permissions             need to be given to the application. In this manner, we are permitting the              application to access a variety of data on our devices.                Think larger now, our mobile phone is connected to the network in your             home or workplace, does this have an effect on the permissions you are              giving?                For example, many of us download applications from the internet onto             our computer systems. During installation, the application will ask you to              check certain options. How many of us read the options and the condi-             tions associated with them?                One of the options may suggest an additional toolbar may be installed on              your browser. Well, that doesn’t really cause much trouble, so that’s not             an issue but with many applications when they give the particular option              they also install other types of programs on your system without your             knowledge and the next time you use your system you will be able to see              certain other application that may pop up at the start of the system, or             suddenly be executed when you are not aware. Many different types of              websites will open without you even clicking on any links. Your system             might become slow because of the running of unwanted programs that              you have installed (without your knowledge). Now that is just one part of             the incident.                Whether it is a computer system or your mobile phone, we need soft-              ware and applications to perform various tasks every single day. To get             more information and knowledge we may have to visit numerous web-              sites. Whatever we do whether we click, swipe or type there is apportion             of data that is getting transferred or exchanged and as lay users of this              technology you wouldn’t know what that data is because we are happy             that we are able to carry out our day-to-day activities. From a perspective              of cybersecurity we would want to know what is the data that is getting             transferred, where is the data destined to go and from where did the data              originate.           60","You wouldn’t really know this until you know your computer system in              and out. Such types of incidents can transmit data from your system to             another person or from another system to your system. When we talk             about data transfer it is not only about information but it could be a set of              instructions. A set of instructions is also known as a software and a soft-              ware can be good and also be bad because a virus is a type of software.               Information technology is a very good day, but as an apple can be eaten              as nutritious food, an apple can be poisoned and used with a wrong in-              tention, in the same manner, information technology can be used in both             ways or the data involved can be used for the right or wrong purposes.             As users of information technology, every individual needs to take care of              what they are doing using this technology, like which site are you visiting,              which applications are you installing, which software are you buying, to             whom are you giving your system for repair or service, to whom you are             giving your mobile phone or computer system to use, what is the type of              transaction that you are doing in your mobile phone, how are you using              your online banking system, etc. All such activities involve the transfer of             data. The data transferred with and from and to your device should not             be misused, should not be tampered with, and should not be stolen. Keep              data safe and keep yourself safe.

However, despite the remarkable de-             velopment in the digital world and the increase in cybersecurity attacks             through digital tools and techniques, most forensic scientists lack the ap-            propriate knowledge to perform investigations under digital forensics but            it is necessary that every organization with a working computer system             needs the services of a qualified digital forensics analyst.               Moreover, owing to the increment of cybercrimes nowadays, digital fo-            rensics is also applied by law enforcement agencies and other corporate             organizations like MNCs across the globe.               The Concept of Digital Forensics:            The Concept of Digital F         orensics:            Digital forensics covers the recovery and investigation of materials detect-             ed in digital devices which are usually concerning computer crimes. In sim-             ple terms, it is the process of identifying, extracting, preserving and doc-            umenting digital evidence through digital tools which can be used in the            court of law.                Similarly, it also provides forensic experts with the greatest strategies and            technologies to deal with complicated computer-based crimes. It also has            several applications in its field but the most widespread use is to disprove             or prove a fact in the court of law.               It  is  also  applied  in  the  corporate            sector for computer hacking in-             vestigations and internal corporate             investigations. Here, the digital fo-            rensics analysts investigate the en-            vironment and degree of an unlaw-           62","ful network intrusion or system hack. The rapidly expanding field of digital            forensics includes numerous branches related to databases, malware, fire-             walls, mobile devices, cloud and network forensics.               Use of Digital Forensics in an Investigation:            Use of Digital F     orensics in an Investigation:            For your digital evidence to be admissible in the court of law, it is necessary             that the materials gathered are handled in a certain manner so that the            evidence may not be tampered with. Most people think that the scope of             digital forensics and incident response are only applicable for organizations            that function in the most security-conscious fields.               However, it is not true because awareness about the digital world and of the             best cybersecurity practices is always beneficial. Regardless of the type or            size of your organization, it is always important that your IT security team             or those responsible for handling your security always follow an informed,            structured, and effective process when a security incident happens.              The general steps that are involved in an investigation of digital forensics             are:               1. Planning -            1. Planning -            The first phase of any successful endeavour is planning. In the digital world,             where events occur quickly, you need to plan your approach. Pinpoint and            prioritize your targets so you can obtain relevant and useful evidence.             Make plans to follow every relevant and regulatory policy. To gather your            evidence on time, you may miss out on some legal requirements which will             render your evidence to be dismissible in the court of law. So always keep            it legal.               2. Identification and Preservation -            2. Identification and Preservation -            The next step is to identify the evidence. Ensure that all the data gathered            have not been tampered with. Don’t work on the original copies, make             duplicates so that the integrity of the original data is preserved. To be on            the safer side, isolate and preserve the original copy. This involves stopping             people from manipulating the evidence.            63","3. Analysis -           3. Analysis -           The next step is to analyse all the evidence, based on the timeframe of           their occurrence. Since you are going to get your data from several sources,            their timestamps may be different. By gathering your data based on their           timeframes, you can build a comprehensive picture of events and pinpoint            a fact supporting your evidence. You need to be systematic about your           analysis. Make a hypothesis and run tests to support all your findings.              4. Documentation -           4. Documentation -           The next step is to generate a report on all the data that you have gathered           to reconstruct the scene of crime. This report must be detailed, under-            standable, factual and must include only defensible data. Make sure that           everything you captured is recorded just as they are, dated, and signed. En-            sure that your report does not contain too much technical linguistics. This           way, even non-technical people can understand your report.              5. Presentation -           5. Presentation -           The final step of any investigation is to present a report of your findings           in the court of law. Your findings must be presented without any bias or            partiality.              While your report summarizes your findings, you still need to ensure that           you answer all the doubts addressed in the court of law diligently. In a more            critical case, other certified forensic scientists can be called upon to verify           your findings.

It is             also considered to be “online video portals” wherein people can pay mon-            ey to watch different live streams and videos of torture, murder, rape, and             even worse. Allegedly, the users have paid over tens of thousands of dollars            to gain access to these gruesome clips.               What is the dark web?            What is the dark web?            As we all know, the internet consists of millions of web pages, servers, and            other databases that are split into three distinctive layers; surface web,             deep web, and the dark web. Being the top layer and the so-called “visible”            layer of the internet, the surface web includes those web pages that are             found using search engines like Google, Yahoo, etc.              If the entire internet is visualized as an iceberg, the surface web would be            just the visible tip of the iceberg that lies above the water and comprises             nearly only 5% of the whole internet. Talking about the deep web, it ac-            counts for almost 90% of all websites and lies below the visible surface. It             is nearly impossible to figure out the exact number of web pages or servers            that are active in the deep web at any given point in time.               The dark web is also a section of this deep             web and includes sites and websites that            are accessible only through limited and             specialized browsers. Although the “deep            web” and the “dark web” are usually con-             sidered the same, a huge fraction of the            deep web is safe and legal, unlike the dark             web. The status of the dark web is often            associated with criminal and illegal activi-             ties, encompassing certain “trading” web-           65","sites where the users can buy illegal goods or services.               Red Rooms Explained-            Red Rooms Explained-            The name “Red Rooms” is believed to have been derived from Videodrome,             a 1983 horror movie in which the torture is shown live on a TV in a room            painted all red. As mentioned earlier, the red rooms are video portals with             the kind of videos depicting violence and pain. Child pornography, imagi-            nary live streams (the browsing speeds on the dark web are considered too             slow for them to be live) of murder and rape, torture, etc. are some of the            contents available on red rooms.  Some red rooms also allow the users to             “chat” with other like-minded people, all while being anonymous.               But do Red Rooms exist?            But do Red Rooms exist?            Although Red Rooms have been a matter of discussion in various forums,             there are no pieces of evidence available that proves their existence. Peter            Scully’s case suggests the possibility of such sites or red rooms being avail-             able for the users to view illegal and gruesome videos or content. Scully            hails from Australia and is entitled as one among the world’s worst paedo-             philes. His modus operandi was luring indigent children by offering gifts            and money and then taking them to his home, in the Philippines. He would             then drug the children and film their torture and rape for an internation-            al paedophile ring. According to reports, he has sold his videos for over             $10,000 per view.               Some people suggest that red rooms are merely a myth or an urban leg-            end, and were invented through a Japanese horror movie called Red Room,             talking about a website that shows live streams of murder. They also point-            ed out that the user’s identity is concealed to gain access to such sites, and             for that purpose, multiple proxies and numerous layers of encryption are            required which makes the process too slow to allow live streaming. On the             other hand, a certain group of people argue that red rooms do exist and it is            possible to access them through certain specialized browsers. But, paying             huge amounts of money to watch gruesome acts is illegal and incriminat-            ing.             66","What is being done to curb the dark web and alleged red rooms?           Policing the dark web is a tedious task due to the anonymity of its users.            Decrypting communications to apprehend criminals involved in illegal ac-           tivities through the dark web has been a matter of debate as it increas-            es the risks of exposing everyone’s data and making it vulnerable. The           whole process is time-consuming and it could take up to a year or two’s            time to gain access to the inner circles within the dark web. The question           of whether the existing acts and laws must be amended to keep up with            the changing trends and challenges also exists as it is difficult to prove a           particular charge concerning the present laws. But for now, training cyber            police officials to face such challenges is much more essential.

Ms. Ann Mariya Thomas              Heston was born in a dysfunctional household. His mother was an alco-            holic and his father a recidivist who was serving time in prison. Heston             would constantly get bullied in his school because of his family back-            ground. He did not have any friends and even the ones he had left him             after they got to know about his father. Heston’s peers isolated him and            thought him to be someone dangerous. Heston had outbursts which led             him to be aggressive and break things in his house. Heston’s mother            would call him his “father’s son” because he was short-tempered just             like his father and this infuriated Heston even more because he did not            want to be his father. Heston decided to endure all this until he could             leave school and live by himself. Hence, he worked hard in school. Until            one day, on his way back home, he was ambushed by one of his bullies             who demanded money from him to which Heston refused. Matters esca-            lated quickly and Heston was brutally beaten up. Before Heston could             stop himself, he took a brick to crush the other kid’s skull. The kid died            and Heston fled the scene.               Heston’s family and his environment as seen above were precarious. De-             spite everything that was going on in his life and no one to support him            other than his alcoholic mother, he had a strong resolve. Then what caused             him to lose all that resolve and kill another person?               Psychologists, criminologists, and forensic psychologists alike have been            studying criminality and criminals for decades. To this day they focus their             research and studies on mapping out the mindset of a criminal before            and after the crime has occurred. If these             studies are brought to fruition and backed            up with strong arguments and evidence, they             can help in crime prevention and help control            crime rates in countries. In the early 1800s,             Cesare Lombroso aimed to study the caus-            es of crime and proposed a biological theory             that indicated that criminality is inherited.        68","Then came the “Golden Age of Research” which showed a rapid prolif-             eration in research and other studies which also included criminality and              criminal behaviour. Scientists proposed various approaches which could             help ascertain the exact causes of crime. However, not all the theories              were consistent with everyone since human behaviour comes with its dis-             crepancies. Undeniably, the crime commission cannot be explained with-              out using a multifaceted approach.                Let us go into a little detail about the biological approach to studying             crime. This mainly proposed that criminality can be inherited. The main              proponent for this approach was Cesare Lombroso who assumed that             some people are “born criminals”.                The theory that I will be focusing on is the Diathesis-Stress Model. This              model is occasionally used in psychopathology and is used to explain the             development of psychological disorders. As the name suggests, it studies              the interaction between a diathesis and stress caused in an individual. Di-             athesis is a genetic predisposition that is inherently present in the individ-              ual. Simply put, diathesis is a vulnerability. Therefore, this theory can also             be called the Stress-Vulnerability model.                Diathesis can include genetic, biological, physiological, cognitive, and per-              sonality-related factors. For example, an abnormality in a gene is passed             down to an individual from one of his parents. Diathesis can also be ac-              quired at an early stage in life, for example, the loss of a loved one. Stress             can be explained as a life event that disrupts the equilibrium of an indi-              vidual. The model proposes that when an individual with a genetic predis-             position or vulnerability encounters a stressor, which pushes them beyond              their threshold, it can result in the development of a disorder. This theory             can also be used to understand criminal behaviour.                In the case of Heston, let us say that he had a vulnerability passed down              by his father who was an offender. This vulnerability might be the quick             temper that he had in common with his father. His upbringing was no-              where near a stable environment for him. Despite this, Heston had a re-            69","solve to be different from his father. However, things went off course when            he was ambushed by one of his bullies. This was his stressor. Thus, when             Heston, who had obtained the diathesis factor from his father, encoun-            tered a stressful event, he succumbed to violence.             What if Heston had never inherited the diathesis from his father? Would            he still have committed the deed? It is improbable but then again there is             no certain answer. However, a way to cope with the diathesis would be to            have a protective factor in the person’s life. In Heston’s case, it would have             been a caring mother and good peers.               The Diathesis-stress model has its shortcomings. It does not stand true with            the offspring of all offenders or any individual with a diathesis. The Diath-             esis-stress model is one among many theories that have been put forth to            understand criminal behaviour and emphatically understand its origin.

Thanatology is concerned            with the notion of death as popularly perceived and especially with the re-           actions of dying.” Thanatology is derived from the Greek word “Thanatos”            meaning death.              Do you know how to estimate time since death?           Do you know how to estimate time since death?           Post-mortem interval (PMI) has been classified into three stages – imme-            diate, early and late.              1) Immediate Post-mortem interval: during this period, the body under-           1) Immediate Post-mortem interval:           goes rapid biochemical changes and even physiological changes because            of the absence of circulation of blood and regulatory mechanisms. These           changes are detectable in the skin and eyes. In the eyes, the first observa-            tional sign is the segmentation of retinal vessels. This usually occurs within           half an hour or two hours after death. The other sign is clouding of the            cornea, as the intraocular pressure decreases to 4mmHg. This clouding of           the cornea occurs within 2 hours after death. The skin loses its elasticity            and lustre within the first few hours after death and appears pale. Thus the           post-mortem interval between somatic and cellular intervals is within 2 to            3 hours after death and usually denotes a lack of discernible changes in the           morphology.              2) Early Post-mortem interval:           2) Early Post-mortem interval:  This period is most relevant in establishing           the timeline of events and developing a theory of circumstances of death.           This period runs from 3 to 72 hours after death. The early post-mortem            phase is most frequently estimated using post-mortem changes – rigor           mortis, livor mortis, and algor mortis.                71","Pallor Mortis - The first stage of death where the corpse becomes pale in            Pallor  Mortis    -            the face and other parts of the body. This is the first sign and occurs im-             mediately within 15- 30 minutes after death. This paleness occurs without            any gender difference.               Rigor Mortis - This occurs immediately after death, it is stiffening of mus-            Rigor Mortis -            cles caused by the depletion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is            necessary to break down the actin-myosin filaments in muscle fibers. The             cessation of oxygen supply causes the stoppage of aerobic respiration in            the cells and leads to a lack of production of ATP. Rigor mortis appears             approximately 2 hours after death in the muscles of the face, progresses            to the limbs over the next few hours, completing between 6 to 8 hours             after death. Rigor mortis then stays for another 12 hours. In the last phase            of Rigor Mortis, the actin-myosin complex that has formed starts disinte-             grating, resulting in the dissolution of the stiffness. Rigor mortis generally            disappears 36 hours after death, followed by a phase known as secondary             flaccidity. The different stages of rigor mortis are :               A) Autolysis - in this stage the blood circulation stops not long after death.            A) Autolysis     -            There won’t be any oxygen supply and it creates an acidic environment as             the cell starts to burst.               B) Bloat -            B) Bloat - The enzymes produce numerous gases. In this stage, putrefac-            tion occurs where the sulphur mixes up with microorganisms and produces             a foul smell.               C) Active decay - all the parts of the body become liquified and hair, bones            C) Active decay -            etc remains.               D) Skeletonisation -            D) Skeletonisation - There is a loss of organic and inorganic components            on the ground.               Algor mortis -            Algor mortis - is the process where the body cools down as body heat is            lost to the environment. The temperature decreases due to fluid evapora-             tion until it reaches equilibrium with the environment. This happens only if            the ambient temperature is cooler than the body temperature at the time        72","of death. This algor mortis is applicable up to 24 hours after death. Usually,            body temperature is maintained stable for 30 min to 1 h after death before             starting to decrease, although this can persist for 5 h in extreme cases.               Livor mortis - which is the purplish-blue discolouration of the skin, due to            Livor mortis -            collection of blood in skin vessels, caused by gravitational pull. The discol-             ouration becomes ‘fixed’ after a certain period, owing to the disintegration            of blood cells and the seepage of haemoglobin. This occurs within hours             after death. Lividity occurs because the heart doesn’t pump the blood over            the body. Lividity begins 30 minutes to 4 hours after death and lasts up to             12 hours. This can help in determining the position of the person when            they died. For example, if a person died on their back the lividity occurred             at their back, like the back of their legs, buttocks.               3) Late post-mortem interval: In this phase, the body tissue starts disin-            3) Late post-mortem interval:            tegrating and is primarily describable as decomposition or putrefaction,             adipocere formation, mummification, or skeletonizing. The body primarily            undergoes decomposition or putrefaction, resulting in greenish discoloura-             tion, bloating due to gas formation, and liquefactive necrosis. The decom-            position of remains is dependent on the climate, the season, body weight,             and clothing.               Adipocere: It is a waxy or soap-like substance formed in the presence of            Adipocere:            anaerobic bacteria. It may occur in bodies deposited in waterlogged graves             or by the side of a river. It is sometimes seen 3-4 weeks after death, al-            though 3 months is more typical.               Mummification: Occurs when the body has been dried out due to heat, but            Mummification:            can also be due to wind or any other factors. It results in the dehydration            of the body and brittleness of the skin. The internal organs can be either             dried depending on the conditions.                      73","WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR BODY AFTER DEATH?

When a child lacks adequate attention and            physical touch during this time they tend to suffer personality disorders in           the future. We have come across different cases where a child below the            age of 12-14 engages in criminal activities. In India, every year there are           about 42,000 cases registered of children below the age of 18 for killing,            raping and theft. About 613 crimes are booked under kids below the age           of 12. Due to the emerging involvement of juveniles in crime, lawmakers            are compelled to come forward with new and stricter laws for the juvenile           system in the country. There have been many theories over the past years            about how a person becomes a serial killer, and how having an unstable           childhood affects a person. From Amarjeet Sada to Mary Bell, we have            heard the stories of the depth of criminal behaviour in children. Apart from           the socio-economic factors which affect the growth of kids which turn            them into criminals at an early age, there is also some trauma that they           face due to isolation and relationships.              INTRODUCTION           INTRODUCTION           Child crimes are one of the crimes that are little addressed and are those           which should be taken seriously to build a healthy society. India stands as            one of the top countries which report child crime cases daily. We come across           the news of different child criminals under theft, assault and rape cases.            In the 2012 Delhi gang-rape case, the main           accused was a juvenile. The other accused in            the case got the death penalty but the minor           was sent to remand home under the juvenile            justice act. Similarly in the Shakthi mill case,           the accused were four adults and a juvenile.            Is the mental instability of juveniles caused           by trauma, the reason that the juvenile justice            act is not rightly implemented?             75","Childhood to adolescence is a beautiful period in a human’s life where one             undergoes most of their biological, emotional and psychological growth.            When a child grows up in an abusive and violent environment they tend to             show some traits of it. It is a common action that parents scold kids when            they make mistakes. But scolding them for every wrong they do and show-             casing abusive behaviour and rude attitude around them to make them            behave good in society doesn’t make any sense. Some children experience             some isolation when they lack parental care and love.               A child when he/she is not given enough affection tries to seek new ways            where they get happiness and satisfaction. For most child crime cases in             India, psychologists say,” children find some pleasure when they do such            crimes.” Some get along with peer groups where they are provided with             drugs and alcohol and they come out as bullies when they begin their own            ‘secret aggressive fantasies’. In other cases, they might be victims of sex-             ual abuse. Studies reveal that 42% of convicted serial killers suffered from            physical abuse as children and 74% suffered from psychological abuse. They             consider themselves as the victims of the trauma they faced and make            their mindset to let others suffer the way they had. Some develop psycho-             pathic behaviour from the abuse they’ve gone through in their childhood.            We might have seen some children addicted to crime movies and they try             to act like the characters in it and behave abnormally. In 2012, the rate of            juvenile crimes increased by over 28,000 which included cases like rape and             murder.               JUVENILE DELINQUENCY            JUVENILE DELINQUENCY            The word JUVENILE comes from the Latin word “Juvenis” meaning young.             Juvenile delinquents are minors between the age group of 10-18, who com-            mit an act that violates the law. Crimes committed by juveniles are called             ‘delinquent acts’ and not “crime” as they are not adults.            According to the juvenile justice act of 1986, the maximum age of a juve-             nile delinquent is 16 years for boys and 18 years for girls. But the nature of            offence has remained unchanged. In today’s world, juvenile delinquency is             treated as a disease in our society. It has turned out to be a serious problem.            Juveniles who commit the crime will be taken to juvenile courts for their          76","case to be heard. Juvenile courts are a type of civil court with rules differ-           ent from that of an adult criminal court. This is based on the legal principle            DOLI INCAPAX; which means a child does not have the capacity to form a           criminal mindset. A juvenile case is opened when a prosecutor files a civil            petition, in which a juvenile is charged for violating the law. After a juvenile           is convicted for a crime he/she will be taken to observation homes/deten-            tion centres that run under the government where they are provided with           education and other activities              How can we prevent juvenile delinquents?           How can we prevent juvenile delinquents?           Preventing it at an early stage is the best as it all starts from the family rela-           tionship. Family is the primary institution of socialization and it plays a very            great role in the prevention of juvenile delinquency. Children role model           their parents. They learn from them and notice every single behaviour their            parents possess in their public and private life.              1. Parents must be trained about family management and how the kids           grow around and absorb the surroundings. They have to create a positive            and friendly atmosphere for the children so that they are free to speak with           their parents about their frustrations and problems.              2. The children must be provided with education programs, youth develop-            ment and activities and given responsibility in dealing with juvenile delin-           quency.              3. Childcare, social and medical services should be provided to the socially            disadvantaged families. Preventing juvenile delinquency not only helps the           youth of the country but also the emerging criminal careers in the future.

The IT rules, 2021 is a significant move from the GoI because for the            first time India has a regulatory mechanism for digital media usage \& prop-           agation and Over-the-Top (OTT) broadcasting material.

The IT Act is a framework that the GoI legislated in 2000 to govern elec-           tronic commerce and to deal with cybercrime. But with the rise of fake            news, misuse of social media and OTT broadcast platforms, India needed a           regulation. The IT Act had a loophole where the intermediary (the person            who did not create the file but only passed it on) was considered a protect-           ed liability and therefore will go unpunished. The IT rules, 2021 addressed            this loophole.              What led to the passage of the IT           What led to the passage of the IT           rules, 2021?           rules, 2021?             In 2018, in a case relating to the            circulation  of videos that included           explicit sexual  violence and rape            (Prajwala vs. Union of India), the           Supreme court summoned the ASG,            India along with representatives of          79","Yahoo, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and WhatsApp to question them           about the rampant spread of such media online. After the hearing, the           court ruled that “the GoI may frame necessary guidelines / SOP and im-            plement them within 2 weeks so as to eliminate child pornography, rape            and gang rape imageries, videos and sites in content hosting platforms and           other applications”.              Following this, the GoI tabled the draft IT rules 2018 during the monsoon            session of the Parliament, 2018. During the discussion on the draft rules,           the GoI also identified the need to place restrictions on online mediums           (including social media, online forums and OTT platforms) from spreading            not only sexual imagery but also fake news and prevent misuse of the on-            line mediums. The GoI decided to set up a parliamentary panel to study the           effect of pornography on children and the effect of fake news on society.           The panel report was tabled in 2020. Following the panel report, the GoI            also held an open house to discuss the rules on 5th January 2019 followed            by ten days for counter comments on the draft rules.             These draft rules, 2018 after many arguments and amendments, were fi-            nally passed as the IT rules, 2021 on 25th February 2021.              What does the IT rules, 2021 hold for a citizen of India?           What does the IT rules, 2021 hold for a citizen of India?             1. A person who shares electronic media online needs to do it with due            diligence.

Myth - Evidence can be collected from the crime      scene using whatever method and the evidence       will still reveal a lot of things.         Fact - Evidence collection is a very crucial pro-       cess which has to be followed properly. If the       evidence is not properly collected using the       standard method, it will not be considered by      the court and it leads to unnecessary wastage of       evidence.

These pungent aromas are a combination of chemical                                        gases emitted by corpses like ammonia and sulphur.
