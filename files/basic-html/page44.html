    <pre style="white-space:pre-line"><code>not settle for anyone else other than Jon. He watched Jon skillfully using his
         pick lock and one of the hooks to open the jammed lock. Jon was a talker

         and Finneas ignored him almost all the time, but he did his job well. “Also,
         sire, I won’t be here for the next few months. I have made some big plans for

         myself,” he said grinning. “But I can get another guy who can do this work
         as well as me. His name is Markus. He tends to travel around a lot, but he is

         thorough with his work. Poor thing, he had to struggle to find a living because
         of his thief of a father,” Jon went on. While Jon kept jabbering, Finneas was

         thinking about matters that he could look for in the case, things that he might
         have overlooked 2 years ago.



         He decided to survey Riverton and the CCTV footage that were available

         nearest to the kiosk.



          Thanks to Cooper and Mads he was able to acquire CCTV footage from and
         near the kiosks and stacked the CDs to take it home and look through them

         thoroughly. Finneas spent the next few days looking through the CDs of the
         footage, to look for any suspicious vehicles since the suspect needed a vehicle

         to cover the long distances. This went on for two weeks, him trying to stay up
         late at night and trying to find any piece of evidence or lead from footage that

         went back two months before the robbery. Some nights, his eyes gave in, and
         he fell asleep, but then he slapped himself awake, drank tons of black coffee

         and got back to work. Clark had lent him a desktop, and he had a laptop and
         computer with him, so he sat and watched three monitors simultaneously

         and took notes at the same time. He talked to Clark on the phone and was
         frustrated about how he had wasted his time and slept on nothing. Clark re-

         assured him saying “Now we have one less thing to look into,” and directed
         him to sleep so that they could work on something else the next morning.

         Finneas was about to give up and get to sleep, but he decided to spend an-
         other hour on the footage. “Just to make sure,” he said to himself. Finneas

         struggled to keep his eyes open, look through all the three monitors and take
         notes at the same time. As he watched the screens something white flashed

         in his periphery. It was from one of the screens on his left. He went back in
         the footage to see if he was not hallucinating. He was not. He saw a white van.

         He slapped himself again so that he could focus and remember the reason
         why the white van seemed so familiar to him. This footage was the one from

         Bonchester, from a street that was near the kiosk which was in Port House.
         His hands were fumbling in excitement and confusion as he tried to grab the</code></pre>
